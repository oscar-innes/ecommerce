HTML first, lets make a good frontend with the icons needed for the frontend., maybe test functionality of passing info into the system.
Layered out in the way the website should be.
Then we do the functionality, make everything work whilst being secure. Document this process as we go (report starts at this stage)
CSS LAST CAUSE BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO


we discoveered we need additional properties enabled for it to work,
so fix schemas 






backend work to do:
- order status and delivery info gets updated and the image changes (but is this more frontend?).
- stripe payments maybe.

once this is done we push on with frontend over crimbo, anything else we can add later as most things are not neccessary otherwise.
